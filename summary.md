# Summary of Bot Modifications

This document summarizes the recent changes and development process for the Conan Server Status bot.

## Phase 1: Displaying Player Level

The initial request was to enhance the bot's status message to include the level of each online player. This involved inspecting the game database to find the `characters` table and modifying the script to query a player's level by their `char_name` and display it in the status embed.

## Phase 2: Playtime Reward System

The next goal was to implement a system to track player playtime and reward them.

1.  **Design:** A new database (`playertracker.db`) was created to persistently store player online time.
2.  **RCON Command Testing:** We determined that the temporary "Idx" from the `ListPlayers` command was the correct identifier for spawning items.
3.  **Implementation & Debugging:** The system was built to track minutes played and issue rewards. A critical `TypeError` was found and fixed, which was caused by a variable shadowing the global `_()` translation function.

## Phase 3: Hardening and Reorganization

Following the initial implementation, several improvements were made to enhance stability, configurability, and project organization.

1.  **RCON Stability:** To fix intermittent RCON connection failures, a retry mechanism was added. The bot now attempts to connect up to three times before marking a server as offline, making it much more resilient to transient network issues.

2.  **Reward System Enhancements:**
    *   **Reward Logging:** A new function was added to log every reward transaction to a text file (`logs/rewards.log`), including timestamp, player name, server, total playtime, and the reward given.
    *   **Full Configurability:** The reward system was made fully configurable through the `config.py` file. The hardcoded reward interval was removed, and now the entire feature (enabling/disabling, reward item, quantity, and playtime interval) is controlled via the `REWARD_CONFIG` settings block.

3.  **Project Organization:**
    *   The project directory was restructured for clarity and to follow standard practices.
    *   New directories (`data/`, `logs/`, `scripts/`) were created to separate the database, logs, and utility scripts from the main application code.
    *   Redundant `.bak` files were removed.
    *   The `.gitignore` file was updated to exclude the new data and log directories, keeping the repository clean.

## Current Status

The bot is now in a robust and stable state.
*   It displays server status, player names, and their current levels.
*   It features a fully configurable and switchable playtime reward system.
*   It logs all rewards to a file for administrative review.
*   It has a clean, organized project structure.
